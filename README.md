## Welcome! I'm `ownerofglory`
### About me:
Software engineer in the automotive domain, developing solutions for [software defined vehicles (SDV)](https://sdv.eclipse.org/).

My overall experience includes:
  - Development of backend services for connected cars

### Disclaimer
This profile is created primarily for **private projects**.

In the past, I taught an online  **Java** course at **[Hillel IT School](https://ithillel.ua/)**.
As a result, there are still several `hillel-*` repositories that I created during online classes and for some student group projects.
