## Welcome! I'm `ownerofglory`

My overall experience includes:
  - Development of backend services for connected cars

### Disclaimer
This profile was created primarily for **private projects**.

In the past, I taught an online  **Java** course at **[Hillel IT School](https://ithillel.ua/)**.
As a result, there are still several `hillel-*` repositories that I created during online classes and for some student group projects.
